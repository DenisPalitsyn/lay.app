It is recommended to use your best judgment and put your safety first, whether you are exchanging initial messages or meeting in person. While you can’t control the actions of others, there are things you can do to help you stay safe:</p>`
  },
  {
    subtitle: 'Online Safety',
    text: `<ul>
<li><h3>Never send money or share your financial information</h3>
Never send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person claims to be in an emergency, wiring money it’s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace where the money went. Never share information that could be used to access your financial accounts. If another member asks you for money, report it to us immediately. For tips on avoiding romance scams, check out some advice from:

https://www.consumersinternational.org/members/members/consumer-rights-protection-centre-of-republic-of-latvia/</li>

<li><h3>Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
Never share personal information, such as your personal code, ID number, home or work address, or details about your daily routine with people you don’t know. If you are a parent, limit the information that you share about your children on your profile and in early communications. Avoid sharing details such as your children’s names and personal details, where they go to school, or their ages or genders.</li>

<li><h3>Stay on the LAY.OOO platform</h3>
Keep conversations on the LAY.OOO platform while you’re getting to know someone. Because exchanges on LAY.OOO are subject to our supervision, users with bad intentions often try to move the conversation to text, messaging apps, email, or phone right away.</li>

<li><h3>The risk of long-distance relationships</h3>
Please be aware of scammers who claim to be from your country but stuck somewhere else, especially if they ask for financial help to return home. Be wary of anyone who will not meet in person or talk on a phone/video call they may not be who they say they are. If someone is avoiding your questions or pushing for a serious relationship without meeting or getting to know you first please contact us immediately.</li>

<li><h3>Report all suspicious and offensive behavior</h3>
Requests for money or donations
Underage users
Harassment, threats, and offensive messages
Inappropriate or harmful behavior during or after meeting in person
Fraudulent profiles
Spam or solicitation including links to commercial websites or attempts to sell products or services
You can report any concerns about suspicious behavior from your profile page.</li>


<li><h3>Protect Your Account</h3>
Be sure to pick a strong password, and always be careful when logging into your account from a public or shared computer. LAY.OOO will never send you an email asking for your username and password information — if you receive an email asking for account information, report it immediately.</li>
</ul>`
  },
  {
    subtitle: 'Meeting in Person',
    text: `<ul><li><h3>Don’t Be In A Rush</h3>
Take your time and get to know the other person before agreeing to meet or chat off LAY.OOO. Don’t be afraid to ask questions to screen for any red flags or personal dealbreakers. A phone or video call can be a useful screening tool before meeting.</li>
<li><h3>Meet in public and stay in public</h3>
Meet for the first few times in a populated, public place — never at your home, your date’s home, or any other private location. If your date pressures you to go to a private location, end the date.</li>
<li><h3>Transportation</h3>
It is necessary to be in control of how you get to and from your date so that you can leave whenever you want. If you’re driving yourself, it’s a good idea to have a backup plan such as a ride-share app or a friend to pick you up.</li>
<li><h3>Know your limits</h3>
Be aware of the effects of drugs or alcohol on you specifically — they can impair your judgment and your alertness. If your date tries to pressure you to use drugs or drink more than you’re comfortable with - end the date.</li>
<li><h3>Risks of personal items or drinks unattended</h3>
Know where your drink comes from and know where it is at all times — only accept drinks poured or served directly from the bartender or server. Many substances that are slipped into drinks to facilitate sexual assault are odorless, colorless, and tasteless. Also, keep your phone, purse, wallet, and anything containing personal information on you at all times.</li>
<li><h3>If  you feel uncomfortable, you should leave</h3>
It’s fine to end the date early if you’re feeling uncomfortable. And if your instincts are telling you something is off or you feel unsafe, ask the bartender or server for help.</li></ul>`
  },
  {
    subtitle: 'Sexual Health & Consent',
    text: `<ul><li><h3>Protect yourself</h3>
When used correctly and consistently, condoms can significantly reduce the risk of contracting and passing on STI’s like HIV. But, be aware of STIs like herpes or HPV that can be passed on through skin-to-skin contact.</li>
<li><h3>Know Your Status</h3>
Not all STIs show symptoms, and you don’t want to be in the dark about your status. Stay on top of your health and prevent the spread of STIs by getting tested regularly.</li>
<li><h3>Talk About It</h3>
Communication is everything: Before you get physically intimate with a partner, talk about sexual health and STI testing. And be aware in some places, it’s actually a crime to knowingly pass on an STI.</li>
<li><h3>Consent</h3>
All sexual activity must start with consent and should include ongoing check-ins with your partner. Verbal communication can help you and your partner ensure that you respect each other’s boundaries. Consent can be withdrawn at any time, and sex is never owed to anyone. Do not proceed if your partner seems uncomfortable or unsure, or if your partner is unable to consent due to the effects of drugs or alcohol.</li></ul>`

A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.</p>`

Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our webpages comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.</p>
